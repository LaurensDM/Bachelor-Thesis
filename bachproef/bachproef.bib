abstract = {Recommender systems for runners primarily rely on existing running traces in an area. In the absence of running traces, recommending running routes is challenging. This paper describes our approach to generating and proposing ”pleasant” running tours that consider the runner’s standard preferences and their distance and elevation constraints. Our algorithm is an approach to solve the cold start recommendation problem in unknown places by mining available map-data. We implemented a prototypical smartphone app that generates and recommends pleasant running routes to evaluate our algorithm’s effectiveness. An in-the-wild user study was conducted, with 11 participants across three cities. We tested the correlation between what is defined as ”pleasant path” by our algorithm and the user’s perception. The results of the user study show a positive correlation and support our algorithm. We also outline implications for the design of successful recommendation algorithms for runners.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we present a system that generates customized pedestrian routes entirely based on data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The system enables users to define to what extent they would like the route to have green areas (e.g., parks, squares, trees), social places (e.g., cafes, restaurants, shops) and quieter streets (i.e., with less road traffic). We present how the greenness, sociability, and quietness factors are defined and extracted from OSM as well as how they are integrated into a routing cost function. We intrinsically evaluate customized routes from one-thousand trips, i.e., origin–destination pairs, and observe that these are, in general, as we intended—slightly longer but significantly more social, greener, and quieter than the respective shortest routes. Based on a survey taken by 156 individuals, we also evaluate the system’s usefulness, usability, controlability, and transparency. The majority of the survey participants agree that the system is useful and easy to use and that it gives them the feeling of being in control regarding the extraction of routes in accordance with their greenness, sociability, and quietness preferences. The survey also provides valuable insights into users requirements and wishes regarding a tool for interactively generating customized pedestrian routes.},
